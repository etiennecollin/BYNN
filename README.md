# *Glycine Max* Root Tip Mitosis Stages Identifier Neural Network

The *Glycine Max* root tip mitosis stage identifier neural network is a project that allows students to countÂ thousands of cells in a few seconds and identify their mitotic stage using artificial intelligence. It allows students to spend less time pointlessly counting cells and more time enjoying Biology.
