# Welcome
**Welcome to the Build Your Image Detection Neural Network (BYIDNN) project, for students, by students.**

This project started with the idea to introduce neural networks, artificial intelligence, to students. For those who are
not familiar with artificial intelligence, the concept may be intimidating; how can my computer learn how to do certain
tasks by itself and help me doing them? The goal of this project is to make this technology accessible and show how it
may be used to optimize and speed-up processes, lose less time doing repetitive tasks and validate manually-found data.

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to program a neural network that detects different objects and counts
them. Of course, with little tweaks, one could do many other things with the model. Feel free to fork the project and
share your own neural network.


# What will I learn?
Essentially, this is what you will learn:

1. What a neural network is, explained simply.
2. How to install the required software to create your own training dataset and your own neural network.
3. How to label your own data using [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme).
4. How to build your own image detection neural network using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and train it on your own images.
5. How to optimize your network and use it.

# How will I learn?
This website describes the creation of a neural network that counts
[*GlycineÂ Max*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean) soy bean root tip cells and, for each cell on the picture,
determines their mitosis[^mitosis] stage. By the end of this project and with the explainations supporting the code, you
will learn how to create your own neural network and should be able to adapt the code to create your own neural network
or simply train it using another image dataset.
